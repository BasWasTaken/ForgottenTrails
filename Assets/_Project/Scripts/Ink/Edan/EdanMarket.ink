=== EdanTownSquare ===
 You are quickly greeted by what appears to be the town square. {TimeOfDay == Night: It is empty now, but the various stalls suggest the place will be lively in a few hours.}{TimeOfDay == Dawn: Most townspeople are probably still asleep, but you already spot two men setting up what appears to be a market stall}{TimeOfDay == Morning or Midday or Afternoon: A few stalls are set up, with merchants plying their wares. It's a small affair compared to other places you've been, but for this corner of the world it might as well be Grand Market of Barralon.}
