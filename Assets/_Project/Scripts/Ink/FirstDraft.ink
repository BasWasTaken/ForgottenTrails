=== Awakening ===
~TimeOfDay = Dawn
~SetLocation(ScotlandEntranceRoadLoc)
You awaken with a start. A dream after all. Of course it was, now that you look back on it. 
You turn on your back, the small canvas tent that shields you from the elements coming into view. You can smell the morning forest and the smouldering remains of your campfire.
->Awakening.Tent

You decide to
+  [{AllowMap()}] -> MapScreen(->Awakening.Tent) // dit moet toch meer consise kunnen...?

*(PackUpEarly)[...pack up]{aglue} pack up.
Or you would, but the grumbling of your stomach tells you that it's not going to be a fun hike without something to eat.

You can check your current hunger level on the right. As time passes, your need for food will increase. You wouldn't be the first adventurer to die of starvation, so keep an eye on it! [Vugs note: not yet implemented] 
->Tent
*[...make some breakfast first]{aglue} make some breakfast.
Your stomach rumbles, and what poor sort would head off without a proper meal first anyway? 
The campfire has yet to go out completely and should be easy to light. With the help of some kindling you gathered last night, it doesn't take you long to get a nice flame going.
The next step would be to hang your pot over the fire, but where did you leave the damn thing?

~Item_Add(pot)
You can find your belongings by clicking on the backpack icon on the right. You can then right click an item and select 'use' to put it into action.
    **[{ItemChoice(cooking)}]
    You set up the small iron stakes and hang the pot on it, placing it nice and snug over the fire. Now, to put some food in. 
        ***[{ItemChoice(food)}]
        {Item_Consume()}
        You drop the {UsedItem} into the pot, resulting in a satisfying sizzle. Good thing master PedrÃ¡l went through that herbology phase last semester, or you would have left them by the wayside in fear of poison.
        A few minutes of stirring and a sprinkle of salt later, your woodland meal is ready to eat. It's not something you'd serve to a king or worse, a mother-in-law, but your stomach is grateful for it nevertheless. 
        {Tent.PackUpEarly: |You can check your current hunger level on the right. As time passes, your need for food will increase. You wouldn't be the first adventurer to die of starvation, so keep an eye on it! [Vugs note: not yet implemented]}
        Fully fed, it's about time to head off if you still want to make some decent progress today. 
        While outside, you can get a general sense of what time it is by looking at the time indicator in the top right. Most actions and events will cause time to progress. The world will differ depending on the day-night cycle, but do not worry on missing out. A Keeper's quest is as much -if not more so- about the journey than it is about the destination. And if Fate wants certain people to meet, she always finds a way. [Vugs note: not yet implemented, time is currently tracked in Inky but needs a coding addition] 
            ~TimeOfDay = Morning
            ****[Pack up]
            You gather your belongings and make sure the fire is thorougly smothered by a heap of sand. With a few steps you move from the small clearing where you made your camp back to the road. Looking north, it slopes gently upward.

*[Go back the way you came]

~PreviousLocation = ScotlandEntranceRoadLoc
->EdinburghCrossroads
=FirstVisit
Step by step, you climb the hill. A worn path guides your feet, a pleasant change of pace from the overgrown woodland you found yourself in only two days ago.
*[Put another foot forward]You take another step. And another. Your legs have carried you all the way from Barralon to here: the far North of the Forgotten Isles. 
    **[Readjust your backpack]You shift the weight of the pack on your shoulders. It's heavy, but that's a small burden to bear for the essentials you carry.
        
        Of course, your most important possession is not carried on your back. Chained to your belt is a large, leatherbound book: your journal. You give it a reaffirming tap. A record of all the things you've seen so far and, equally important, plenty of empty pages left to fill with discoveries of the North. 
        
        You can check the contents of your journal by clicking its corresponding icon, on the right. [Vugs note: not yet implemented]
        
        No keeper has set foot here in two hundred years, and even those long dead explorers never ventured deeply into the wilds. Without a doubt, you will be able to complete your task here; to find knowledge not yet stored in the Vault of Barralon. From local folklore to a survey of the wildlife, anything will do. But you did not venture all this way to write down the mundane. You came to find something old. Something ancient, from before the sundering. 
        
        As you contemplate your quest, you realize your feet have carried you to the top of the hill. 
        ***[Survey the landscape]Beneath a bright morning sky fields of flowers roll out before you. The road winds down the hill, slowly making its descent before starting to climb again far in the distance. Its destination: a castle on a rocky outcrop. From your vantage point, you can see the land flattening out beyond it, eventually meeting the inlet sea. 
            ****[Continue following the road towards the castle]
            You continue your journey, the earth crunching beneath your feet. Almost at the halfway point between your hilltop outlook and the castle you find yourself at a crossroads.

{You decide to take a closer look at the Waystone in the middle of the crossing. It's decorated in a blocky script, which thankfully matches the sources you were able to study back in Barralon. In the Northern Tongue it reads:|You decide to take another look at the Waystone. It reads:}
"May the blessings of CrÃ¬sdaen be upon the honorable traveler

From this stone to Edan Castle, 7 miles Northbound
From this stone to the Sea, 8 miles Eastbound
From this stone to Thahnford, 107 miles Southbound"

A fourth line is also there, but the markings are scratched out. Carved beneath it in a freeform script -that barely passes as legible- is written a single word: "daemons".

As you crest the hilltop a gatehouse comes into view. Its stones are worn, ancient. The top parts seem to have crumbled at some point, having now been replaced by wooden battlements. As you step forward in approach you hear a voice call out loudly from inside the gatehouse:

"Halt! Who goes there, man or beast?"

*   "Man!" [] you shout back at him. 
    After a brief moment of quiet a reply comes from inside:
    "Alright {lad}, approach!"
    -> CastleEntranceFirstApproach
    
*   (joke)"Beast!" [] you shout back, mockingly.
    With a hint of anger, the voice replies:
    "Alright then you joker, come closer!"
    -> CastleEntranceFirstApproach    
    
*   [Stay quiet] A few seconds pass in silence. Then the voice rings out again, this time slightly quivering:
        "I won't ask again! Identify yourself!"
    **   [Identify yourself] "Just a traveler!" you shout.
        There's a slight pause and while you can't hear it through the thick walls, you can only imagine the guardsman let out a sigh of relief before replying
        "Don't scare me like that {lad}! Please, approach!"
        -> CastleEntranceFirstApproach
    **   [Remain quiet]
        You hear a bell being rung on the otherside of the wall. The next few moments pass by in a blurr as you hear several people shouting and running behind the wall. There's a low thud followed by a piercing pain. You look down at your chest and as you see the shaft of an arrow sticking out, you realize the gravity of your mistake. You try to raise your arms to somehow remedy the situation, but two more arrows find their mark. You fall to the ground, quickly shifting out of concsiousness and this mortal plane. 
-> Death

= CastleEntranceFirstApproach
You bring yourself nearer to the gatehouse. Two wooden doors are set beneath the archway, barring the way forward. As you stand before them a small latch is opened to reveal two {TimeOfDay == Dawn: tired blue eyes} crowned by a pair of bushy eyebrows{CastleEntranceFirst.joke: that are frowning in disaproval}.

{CastleEntranceFirst.joke: The man sighs, "Look {lad}, I appreciate your attempt at a joke -Gods know we could use some more humor out here- but on a bad day behaviour like that could get you killed. I've heard stories of wraiths speaking, wouldn't want to accidentally think you're one." | "Welcome to the castle {lad}, safest place in the North!" The man's eyes smile, most likely along with his mouth that's still hidden behind the door, "Sorry for all the precaution, can't be too careful with them wraiths out there."}
*"Could you let me in?"
    {CastleEntranceFirst.joke: "Alright, just behave would ye?" | "Of course {lad}, just a moment."}
    The man steps back and swings the latch shut. You hear the rustling of keys and the clunky rattling of locks, followed by a single door being opened inward. The man stands behind it holding the door open for you with one hand while leaning on a spear with the other. He's an old sort, nearing his fifties, but broadchested and with seemingly a strong arm. 
    
    As you step inside the man shuts the door behind you, taking great care to put the locks back into place.
