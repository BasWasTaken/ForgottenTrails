Step by step, you climb the hill. A worn path guides your feet, a pleasant change of pace from the overgrown woodland you found yourself in only two days ago.
*[Put another foot forward]You take another step. And another. Your legs have carried you all the way from Barralon to here: the far North of the Forgotten Isles. 
    **[Readjust your backpack]You shift the weight of the pack on your shoulders. It's heavy, but that's a small burden to bear for the essentials you carry.
        
        Of course, your most important possession is not carried on your back. Chained to your belt is a large, leatherbound book: your journal. You give it a reaffirming tap. A record of all the things you've seen so far and, equally important, plenty of empty pages left to fill with discoveries of the North. 
        
        You can check the contents of your journal by clicking its corresponding icon, on the right. [Vugs note: not yet implemented]
        
        No keeper has set foot here in two hundred years, and even those long dead explorers never ventured deeply into the wilds. Without a doubt, you will be able to complete your task here; to find knowledge not yet stored in the Vault of Barralon. From local folklore to a survey of the wildlife, anything will do. But you did not venture all this way to write down the mundane. You came to find something old. Something ancient, from before the sundering. 
        
        As you contemplate your quest, you realize your feet have carried you to the top of the hill. 
        ***[Survey the landscape]Beneath a bright morning sky fields of flowers roll out before you. The road winds down the hill, slowly making its descent before starting to climb again far in the distance. Its destination: a castle on a rocky outcrop. From your vantage point, you can see the land flattening out beyond it, eventually meeting the inlet sea. 
            ****[Continue following the road towards the castle]
            You continue your journey, the earth crunching beneath your feet. Almost at the halfway point between your hilltop outlook and the castle you find yourself at a crossroads.

The road splits here into four directions. The northbound road {!HasVisited(LOC_EdanCastle) and Knows(edanca.Exists): presumably |}leads to {Knows(EdanCastleKnow.IsCastleOnHill):Edan Castle|the castle on the hill}{PreviousLocation ? LOC_RoadToEdanCastle:, from which you came|.} The road South would carry you away from the Northern Lands, perhaps even all the way back home{PreviousLocation ? LOC_ScotlandEntranceRoad:, but you just came from there.|.} You're unsure where the roads leading East and West would take you.
At the center of the crossing you spot a decorated boulder: a Waystone.

~ Learn(EdanCastleKnow.Exists)
{You decide to take a closer look at the Waystone in the middle of the crossing. It's decorated in a blocky script, which thankfully matches the sources you were able to study back in Barralon. In the Northern Tongue it reads:|You decide to take another look at the Waystone. It reads:}
"May the blessings of CrÃ¬sdaen be upon the honorable traveler

From this stone to Edan Castle, 7 miles Northbound
From this stone to the Sea, 8 miles Eastbound
From this stone to Thahnford, 107 miles Southbound"

A fourth line is also there, but the markings are scratched out. Carved beneath it in a freeform script -that barely passes as legible- is written a single word: "daemons".
